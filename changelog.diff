\\\ANNOUNCEMENTS\\\
Nov. 25 2018

Hey guys, welcome to your new category for anything related to ARK : Survival Evolved. Wether the player count grows or stays the same, this will be your home for ARK outside of the game.
I will provide announcements for anything new. Such as mod descriptions, sudden server outages, or something as small as suggestions. This channel will allow you to leave reactions. If you have any concerns leave a message via #lobby~1.
In addition to the #ark-announcements, we have #ark-changelog. I will also be providing a changelog of what goes into the or out of the server via mods. If there is also any major changes, it will also be placed in that channel.
Feel free to use #media~1 to show off your cool builds, dinos, and human!
